Hi,

my name is Martin, 22 years old and I'm a Computer Science student and iOS-Developer from Germany, currently living in Amsterdam. You can have a look at my Apps at [mhaddl.me](http://mhaddl.me).

This is the place where I write about stuff I'm interested in. It's mostly about Apple, Objective-C and Swift programming, technology and everything else that comes to my mind.
