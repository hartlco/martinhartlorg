As of today, this blog is now hosted on a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com) VPS. This does not mean I'm not longer a fan of [Uberspace](https://uberspace.de), but Ghost and a lot of other stuff wasn't the right fit for shared hosting plan anymore.
The 100$ credit I received with the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) also led to making the switch sooner than later.

Digital Ocean offers a ton of tutorials and guides on how to set up the server, install all kinds of software and set up domains. The community is also very helpful. I already learned a lot.

I hope everything went well. If you can read this, it probably did.
