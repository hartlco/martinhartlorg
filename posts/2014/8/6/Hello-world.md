Hi,

my name is Martin, I'm a computer science student and iOS developer from Germany. You can see my Apps [here](http://mhaddl.me).

This is going to be the place where I write about Apple, tech, programming, life and everything else I'm interested in.

It is my first time trying to write something meaningful in English, so feel free to contact me about misspellings or grammatical flaws. All content of this site will be open sourced on [Github](https://github.com/martinhartlorg). This includes the Ghost theme and all the posts. So the best way to point to errors is by pull request or issues. 

I'm starting this site now because a lot is going to change for me in the next few weeks. My girlfriend and I are going to move to Amsterdam for half a year. I will finish my degree with an internship, so there is a lot to learn, experience and to write about.

Feel free to subscribe to the [RSS-Feed](http://martinhartl.org/rss/) or follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mhaddl).
