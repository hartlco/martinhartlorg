As I mentioned [earlier](http://martinhartl.org/behind-the-scenes/), this Blog runs on Ghost. With the release of version 0.5, the first parts of an restful JSON API were made public. This begs for a native iOS App, and I'm sure a lot developers are already working on it. I want a minimal, barley useful App to manage my posts and blog on the go as fast a possible, so I started Ghosty.

Ghosty will be completely written in Swift, iOS 8 only and the best part: open source. Every commit will be pushed to [Github](https://github.com/mhaddl/Ghosty). Pull request are very welcome, even small suggestions, icons, typos etc. Swift is very new, I'm still learning and try to wrap my head around more functional paradigms, so there will be a lot room for improvements and comments.

In the upcoming days I'm going to add a readme to the repository, explaining the rules I set myself, planned features and the whole idea behind it. Stay tuned.
