@@ Title=How to leave the OS X Beta Track
@@ Date=2014-12-01

Over the summer I used my Macbook Air to test the beta builds of OS X 10.10 Yosemite. I installed the latest GM release a few days before the official release in October and mentally closed the chapter of testing a beta operating system. 

A few days ago I noticed that the first beta of 10.10.2 got installed while my Macbook was asleep overnight. This was the first time I realised that I'm still subscribed to the beta track. After 5 seconds of search I found a way how to unsubscribe from these updates:

Go to System Preferences.app - App Store:

For now I'm continuing to install the betas, because the last update broke a lot, so it can't get worse right now. After the release of 10.10.2, disabling the beta updates is the first thing I'm going to do.
